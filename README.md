# What is a control flow?
    A program's control flow is the order in which the program's instructions are executed.
# Which example shows the correct syntax for a while loop?
while () {
    String userInput = input.next();
    if (userInput.equals("yes")) {
        isOnRepeat = false; }
}

while (isOnRepeat) {
    String userInput = input.next();
}

while (isOnRepeat) {
    String userInput = input.next();
    if (userInput.equals("yes")) {
        isOnRepeat = false; }
}
# How would you describe a while loop?
Check whether the condition is true; if it is true, then keep repeating until the condition is false.
A `while` loop keeps repeating a block of code as long as the condition evaluates to a true value.

# What best describes a breakpoint?
an intentional stopping point put into a program for debugging purposes. A breakpoint allows you to stop the program at a particular line of code, and is thus a useful debugging tool.

# Which scenario represents a logic error? 
displaying output that the user guessed incorrectly, when the user's answer is spelled correctly but is capitalized

# What is the main characteristic of a syntax error?
It causes a program to fail before it is able to run. Source code that has a syntax error will not compile, and spelling a keyword wrong is a common cause of this.

# When is an appropriate time to use a breakpoint?
to determine whether a block of code is not executing as it should. A breakpoint is a useful tool to examine whether a piece of code is being executed or skipped.

# What are functions? 
a function is just a series of finite steps that accomplish some task.

# why use functions? 
Functions help developers organize their code in a meaningful way. Organizing a series of steps under a label helps us keep track of certain tasks we might want to accomplish in our program.
