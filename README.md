# What is a control flow?
    A program's control flow is the order in which the program's instructions are executed.
# Which example shows the correct syntax for a while loop?
while () {
    String userInput = input.next();
    if (userInput.equals("yes")) {
        isOnRepeat = false; }
}

while (isOnRepeat) {
    String userInput = input.next();
}

while (isOnRepeat) {
    String userInput = input.next();
    if (userInput.equals("yes")) {
        isOnRepeat = false; }
}
# How would you describe a while loop?
Check whether the condition is true; if it is true, then keep repeating until the condition is false.
A `while` loop keeps repeating a block of code as long as the condition evaluates to a true value.

# What best describes a breakpoint?
an intentional stopping point put into a program for debugging purposes. A breakpoint allows you to stop the program at a particular line of code, and is thus a useful debugging tool.
